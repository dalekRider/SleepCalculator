# SleepCalculator
Sleep Calculator Solution

The project train keeps rolling. This is another project completed through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. This is a simple sleep calculator. It takes the users number of hours of sleep per day then checks that against the actual number of hours of sleep per day and returns a result. The result includes a log stating if the amount was over, under, or just right. If the amount of sleep was less or more than the required amount the script provides the difference value in the log statement. 

This script uses both switch statements and if else/if statements. 

Normally, I like to provide a revised version making use of prompts and alerts for interactivity before building a page for it. This time I did not. I felt that having 7 prompts would be annoying. I plan to use inputs on a page for this instead. This will happen at a later time. 

Please feel free to ask any questions if you have them.

### Update 1/17/2018
As the other repos have stated I am going through my list of unfinished business and knocking them out. This is one of two repos I decided not to make a quick index page to run the script. The current script does not allow for any actual input. It will still require opening console and changing variables. The core of the program will remain the same but I plan to overhaul this to make it a useful web app. Because this will be more complex than some of the other projects this will be one of the last ones I tackle
